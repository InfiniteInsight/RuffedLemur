# RuffedLemur

This is a placeholder for an upcoming updated version of Netflix's Lemur Certificate Manager that I am calling Ruffed Lemur, instead of just calling it Lemur 2.0

It is an update from AngularJS to modern Angular and Typescript. I am planning on adding new features as well as some quality of life overhauls. This is my first TypeScript/Javascript project so I may wend and wind a bit, trying various things to try and learn as much as I can.
